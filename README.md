# BAFFLES: Bayesian Ages for Lower-mass Field Stars

This package computes age posteriors for field stars from measurements of R'HK calcium emission and/or B-V color and lithium equivalent width absorption (Li EW).  For calcium emission our method is calibrated to stars with B-V between 0.45 and 0.9 (~ F6-K2) and 
log(R'HK) between -3.7 and -5.  For lithium we have calibrated BAFFLES to stars with B-V between 0.35 and 1.9 (~F2-M5) and Li EW between 3.2 and 1500 mA.  See the paper Stanford-Moore et al. 2019.

## Command Line Usage Examples

Quick usage from the command line. Let's find an age for the sun using B-V of 0.65 and logR'HK = -4.908 (Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008).
 
```python baffles.py -bmv 0.65 -rhk -4.906 -plot```

To save this probability density function in a csv file as 1000 lines of age,probability with optional filename (_calcium.csv will be appended to name):

```python baffles.py -bmv 0.65 -rhk -4.906 -plot -s -filename suns_age```



Now lets find the age of HR 2562 using B-V=.45 ± .02, log(R'HK) = -4.55 (Gray 2006), and lithium EW of 21 ± 5 (Mesa el al 2018). "-ul" would denote an upper limit.  "-s" will save a csv file of the posterior. "-plot" will show a plot of the posterior. -maxAge 10000 will constrain the prior on age to be uniform out to 10 Gyr. "-li_err" allows input of uncertainty
on Li EW, and "-bv_err" uncertainty on B-V. The following command will determine the age using calcium and lithium separately and then find the combined posterior product.    

```python baffles.py -bmv 0.45 -bmv_err .02 -rhk -4.55 -li 21 -li_err 5 -plot```

Type `python baffles.py -help` into the command line to learn more.
